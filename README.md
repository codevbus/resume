# Mike Vanbuskirk's Resume

After a long run with LaTeX, I've decided to move to [Typst](https://typst.app/). Typst similar to LaTeX, but more modern and user-friendly. 

This document will be a work in progress, and I will update it as needed with relevant experience, projects, and aesthetic modifications.
